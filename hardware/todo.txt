Reading around it seems like the RP2040 could power up and start querying the external quad-spi
flash before it's had a chance to power up as well. This seems to be a problem when there is
lots of capacitance on the 3v3 net, there is roughly 4uF at the current revision (controller_b_r1).
If I notice any problems I'll look into making a circuit that'll hold the RP2040 in reset while
supply voltage is below a threshold.

put power supply switch back on power board
swap crystal for crystal oscilator !!!!
get push buttons with more travel
look into more robust cabling options
light level sensor
use thermal reliefs!!
always use a dot for pin 1!!
the usb port doesnt need the overhang
usb port could be through hole, then file down pins on far side
usb usb c!!!
relax current and thermal efficiency requirements for power board, leds are much worse!! (smaller inductor would be nice)
make front board narrower
more test points !!!
less caps on led board, maybe 1 for every 5
90 deg magnet plug for power cable?
